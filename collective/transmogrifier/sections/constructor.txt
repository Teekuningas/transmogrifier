Constructor section
===================

A constructor pipeline section is the heart of a transmogrifier content
imprort pipeline. It constructs Plone content based on the items it processes.
The constructor section blueprint name is
``collective.transmogrifier.sections.constructor``.

Construction needs at least 3 pieces of information: the path to the folder
where to create the object, it's id, and it's portal type.
