Splitter section
================

A splitter pipeline section lets you branch a pipeline into 2 or more
sub-pipelines.

.. WARNING::
    A splitter section has to, by it's very nature, keep a buffer of items not
    interesting to the currently active sub-pipe. This can cause it to eat
    memory quite rapidly for item streams that are not uniformly mixed.

    Use a custom pipe section with the conditional sections contained wholly
    within it to avoid this trap.
