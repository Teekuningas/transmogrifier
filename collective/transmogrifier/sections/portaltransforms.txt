Portal Transforms section
=========================

A portal transforms pipeline section lets you use Portal Transforms to
transform item values. The portal transforms section blueprint name is
``collective.transmogrifier.sections.portaltransforms``.

What values to transform is determined by the ``keys`` option, which takes a
set of newline-separated key names. If a key name starts with ``re:`` or
``regexp:`` it is treated as a regular expression instead.

You can specify what transformation to apply in two ways. Firstly, you can
directly specify a transformation by naming it with the ``transform`` option;
the named transformation is run directly. Alternatively you can let the portal
transforms tool figure out what transform to use by specifying ``target`` and
an optional ``from`` mimetype. The portal transforms tool will select one or
more transforms based on these mimetypes, and if no ``from`` option is given
the original item value is used to determine one.
